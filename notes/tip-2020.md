# Tips

Before starting, do the following

* Think about multiple solutions, if any, and analyze the complexity.
* Walk through an example.
* Draw a table of the state history if the update rule is complex.

## Pointers

* Follow the python convention: inclusive `start` and exclusive `end`: `a[start:end]`.
* A few trivial equations
  * `start = first`
  * `end = last + 1`
  * `range = end - start = last - start + 1`

## Binary Search

To avoid getting stuck in a bad state, loosen the termination condition and do a brutal force check in the range
outside.

```
while start < end - 2:
  start, end = find()
for idx in range(start, end):
  if is_good(idx):
    return idx
return end
```
