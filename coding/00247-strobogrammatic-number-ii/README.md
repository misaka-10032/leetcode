# Strobogrammatic Number II

https://leetcode.com/problems/strobogrammatic-number-ii/

## Solution

We search the possible strobogrammatic numbers (0, 1, 6, 8, 9) until we go beyond the middle one. The middle number is
tricky when the length is odd, because only fewer numbers can appear there (0, 1, 8).
